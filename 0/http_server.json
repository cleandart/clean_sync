{"dependencies":[{"kind":"library","name":"dart:core","id":"dart.core","comment":"\n\nBuilt-in types, collections,\nand other core functionality for every Dart program.\n\nThis library is automatically imported.\n\nSome classes in this library,\nsuch as [String] and [num],\nsupport Dart's built-in data types.\nOther classes, such as [List] and [Map], provide data structures\nfor managing collections of objects.\nAnd still other classes represent commonly used types of data\nsuch as URIs, dates and times, and errors.\n\n## Numbers and booleans\n\n[int] and [double] provide support for Dart's built-in numerical data types:\nintegers and double-precision floating point numbers, respectively.\nAn object of type [bool] is either true or false.\nVariables of these types can be constructed from literals:\n\n    int meaningOfLife = 42;\n    double valueOfPi  = 3.141592;\n    bool visible      = true;\n\n## Strings and regular expressions\n\nA [String] is immutable and represents a sequence of characters.\n\n    String shakespeareQuote = \"All the world's a stage, ...\";\n\n[StringBuffer] provides a way to construct strings efficiently.\n\n    StringBuffer moreShakespeare = new StringBuffer();\n    moreShakespeare.write('And all the men and women ');\n    moreShakespeare.write('merely players; ...');\n\nThe String and StringBuffer classes implement string concatenation,\ninterpolation, and other string manipulation features.\n\n    String philosophy = 'Live on ';\n    String get palindrome => philosophy + philosophy.split('').reversed.join();\n\n[RegExp] implements Dart regular expressions,\nwhich provide a grammar for matching patterns within text.\nFor example, here's a regular expression that matches\na string of one or more digits:\n\n    var numbers = new RegExp(r'\\d+');\n\nDart regular expressions have the same syntax and semantics as\nJavaScript regular expressions. See\n<http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.10>\nfor the specification of JavaScript regular expressions.\n\n## Collections\n\nThe dart:core library provides basic collections,\nsuch as [List], [Map], and [Set].\n\nA List is an ordered collection of objects, with a length.\nLists are sometimes called arrays.\nUse a List when you need to access objects by index.\n\n    List superheroes = [ 'Batman', 'Superman', 'Harry Potter' ];\n\nA Set is an unordered collection of unique objects.\nYou cannot get an item by index (position).\nAdding a duplicate item has no effect.\n\n    Set villains = new Set();\n    villains.add('Joker');\n    villains.addAll( ['Lex Luther', 'Voldemort'] );\n\nA Map is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.\nMaps are sometimes called associative arrays because\nmaps associate a key to some value for easy retrieval.\nKeys are unique.\nUse a Map when you need to access objects\nby a unique identifier.\n\n    Map sidekicks = { 'Batman': 'Robin',\n                      'Superman': 'Lois Lane',\n                      'Harry Potter': 'Ron and Hermione' };\n\nIn addition to these classes,\ndart:core contains [Iterable],\nan interface that defines functionality\ncommon in collections of objects.\nExamples include the ability\nto run a function on each element in the collection,\nto apply a test to each element,\nto retrieve an object, and to determine length.\n\nIterable is implemented by List and Set,\nand used by Map for its keys and values.\n\nFor other kinds of collections, check out the\n[dart:collection](#dart-collection) library.\n\n## Date and time\n\nUse [DateTime] to represent a point in time\nand [Duration] to represent a span of time.\n\nYou can create DateTime objects with constructors\nor by parsing a correctly formatted string.\n\n    DateTime now = new DateTime.now();\n    DateTime berlinWallFell = new DateTime(1989, 11, 9);\n    DateTime moonLanding = DateTime.parse(\"1969-07-20\");\n\nCreate a Duration object specifying the individual time units.\n\n    Duration timeRemaining = new Duration(hours:56, minutes:14);\n\nIn addition to DateTime and Duration,\ndart:core contains the [Stopwatch] class for measuring elapsed time.\n\n## Uri\n\nA [Uri] object represents a uniform resource identifier,\nwhich identifies a resource on the web.\n\n    Uri dartlang = Uri.parse('http://dartlang.org/');\n\n## Errors\n\nThe [Error] class represents the occurrence of an error\nduring runtime.\nSubclasses of this class represent specific kinds of errors.\n\n## Other documentation\n\nFor more information about how to use the built-in types, refer to\n[Built-in Types](http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch02.html#built-in-types)\nin Chapter 2 of\n[Dart: Up and Running](http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/).\n\nAlso, see\n[dart:core - Numbers, Collections, Strings, and More](http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch03.html#ch03-dartcore---strings-collections-and-more)\nfor more coverage of classes in this package.\n\nThe\n[Dart Language Specification](http://www.dartlang.org/docs/spec/)\nprovides technical details.\n","children":[{"kind":"class","name":"Object","id":"Object","comment":"\nThe base class for all Dart objects.\n\nBecause Object is the root of the Dart class hierarchy,\nevery other Dart class is a subclass of Object.\n\nWhen you define a class, you should override [toString]\nto return a string describing an instance of that class.\nYou might also need to define [hashCode] and [==], as described in the\n[Implementing map keys]\n(http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch03.html#ch03-implementing-map-keys)\nsection of the [library tour]\n(http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch03.html).\n","children":[{"returnType":{"name":"bool","refId":"dart.core/bool"},"isOperator":true,"kind":"method","name":"==","id":"==1()","comment":"\nThe equality operator.\n\nThe default behavior for all [Object]s is to return true if and\nonly if [:this:] and [other] are the same object.\n\nOverride this method to specify a different equality relation on\na class.

Only when\nthe user starts listening to the bound stream, the `listen` method\ninvokes the given closure [transformer].\n\nThe [transformer] closure receives the stream, that was bound, as argument\nand returns a [StreamSubscription]. In almost all cases the closure\nlistens itself to the stream that is given as argument.\n\nThe result of invoking the [transformer] closure is a [StreamSubscription].\nThe bound stream-transformer (created by the `bind` method above) then sets\nthe handlers it received as part of the `listen` call.\n\nConceptually this can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. `var transformer = new StreamTransformer(transformerClosure);`\n  creates a `StreamTransformer` that supports the `bind` method.\n2. `var boundStream = stream.transform(transformer);` binds the `stream`\n  and returns a bound stream that has a pointer to `stream`.\n3. `boundStream.listen(f1, onError: f2, onDone: f3, cancelOnError: b)`\n  starts the listening and transformation. This is accomplished\n  in 2 steps: first the `boundStream` invokes the `transformerClosure` with\n  the `stream` it captured: `transformerClosure(stream, b)`.\n  The result `subscription`, a [StreamSubscription], is then\n  updated to receive its handlers: `subscription.onData(f1)`,\n  `subscription.onError(f2)`, `subscription(f3)`. Finally the subscription\n  is returned as result of the `listen` call.\n\nThere are two common ways to create a StreamSubscription:\n\n1. by creating a new class that implements [StreamSubscription].\n   Note that the subscription should run callbacks in the [Zone] the\n   stream was listened to.\n2. by allocating a [StreamController] and to return the result of\n   listening to its stream.\n\nExample use of a duplicating transformer:\n\n    stringStream.transform(new StreamTransformer<String, String>(\n        (Stream<String> input, bool cancelOnError) {\n          StreamController<String> controller;\n          StreamSubscription<String> subscription;\n          controller = new StreamController<String>(\n            onListen: () {\n              subscription = input.listen((data) {\n                  // Duplicate the data.\n                  controller.add(data);\n                  controller.add(data);\n                },\n                onError: controller.addError,\n                onDone: controller.close,\n                cancelOnError: cancelOnError);\n            },\n            onPause: subscription.pause,\n            onResume: subscription.resume,\n            onCancel: subscription.cancel,\n            sync: true);\n          return controller.stream.listen(null);\n        });\n","children":[{"ref":{"name":"Function","refId":"dart.core/Function"},"kind":"param","name":"transformer","id":"transformer","children":[{"returnType":{"name":"StreamSubscription","refId":"dart.async/StreamSubscription","arguments":[{"name":"T","refId":"dart.async/StreamTransformer/T"}]},"kind":"functiontype","name":"Function","id":"Function","children":[{"ref":{"name":"Stream","refId":"dart.async/Stream","arguments":[{"name":"S","refId":"dart.async/StreamTransformer/S"}]},"kind":"param","name":"stream","id":"stream","uri":"dart-sdk/lib/async/stream.dart","line":"1315"},{"ref":{"name":"bool","refId":"dart.core/bool"},"kind":"param","name":"cancelOnError","id":"cancelOnError","uri":"dart-sdk/lib/async/stream.dart","line":"1315"}],"uri":"dart-sdk/lib/core/function.dart","line":"13"}],"line":"1315"}],"line":"1314"},{"returnType":{"name":"StreamTransformer","refId":"dart.async/StreamTransformer","arguments":[{"name":"S","refId":"dart.async/StreamTransformer/S"},{"name":"T","refId":"dart.async/StreamTransformer/T"}]},"kind":"constructor","name":"fromHandlers","id":"fromHandlers3()","comment":"\nCreates a [StreamTransformer] that delegates events to the given functions.\n\nExample use of a duplicating transformer:\n\n    stringStream.transform(new StreamTransformer<String, String>.fromHandlers(\n        handleData: (String value, EventSink<String> sink) {\n          sink.add(value);\n          sink.add(value);

The content\nbody is parsed, depending on the `Content-Type` header field. When\nthe full body is read and parsed the body content is made\navailable. The class can be used to process both server requests\nand client responses.\n\nThe following content types are recognized:\n\n    text/ *\n    application/json\n    application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n    multipart/form-data\n\n For content type `text/\\*` the body is decoded into a string. The\n 'charset' parameter of the content type specifies the encoding\n used for decoding. If no 'charset' is present the default encoding\n of ISO-8859-1 is used.\n\n For content type `application/json` the body is decoded into a\n string which is then parsed as JSON. The resulting body is a\n [Map].  The 'charset' parameter of the content type specifies the\n encoding used for decoding. If no 'charset' is present the default\n encoding of UTF-8 is used.\n\n For content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` the body is a\n query string which is then split according to the rules for\n splitting a query string. The resulting body is a `Map<String,\n String>`.  If the same name is present several times in the query\n string, then the last value seen for this name will be in the\n resulting map. The encoding US-ASCII is always used for decoding\n the body.\n\n For content type `multipart/form-data` the body is parsed into\n it's different fields. The resulting body is a `Map<String,\n dynamic>`, where the value is a [String] for normal fields and a\n [HttpBodyFileUpload] instance for file upload fields. If the same\n name is present several times, then the last value seen for this\n name will be in the resulting map.\n\n When using content type `multipart/form-data` the encoding of\n fields with [String] values is determined by the browser sending\n the HTTP request with the form data. The encoding is specified\n either by the attribute `accept-charset` on the HTML form, or by\n the content type of the web page containing the form. If the HTML\n form has an `accept-charset` attribute the browser will use the\n encoding specified there. If the HTML form has no `accept-charset`\n attribute the browser determines the encoding from the content\n type of the web page containing the form. Using a content type of\n `text/html; charset=utf-8` for the page and setting\n `accept-charset` on the HTML form to `utf-8` is recommended as the\n default for [HttpBodyHandler] is UTF-8. It is important to get\n these encoding values right, as the actual `multipart/form-data`\n HTTP request sent by the browser does _not_ contain any\n information on the encoding. If something else than UTF-8 is used\n `defaultEncoding` needs to be set in the [HttpBodyHandler]\n constructor and calls to [processRequest] and [processResponse].\n\n For all other content types the body will be treated as\n uninterpreted binary data. The resulting body will be of type\n `List<int>`.\n\nTo use with the [HttpServer] for request messages, [HttpBodyHandler] can be\nused as either a [StreamTransformer] or as a per-request handler (see\n[processRequest]).\n\n    HttpServer server = ...\n    server.transform(new HttpBodyHandler())\n        .listen((HttpRequestBody body) {\n          ...\n        });\n\nTo use with the [HttpClient] for response messages, [HttpBodyHandler] can be\nused as a per-request handler (see [processResponse]).\n\n    HttpClient client = ...\n    client.get(...)\n        .then((HttpClientRequest response) => response.close())\n        .then(HttpBodyHandler.processResponse)\n        .then((HttpClientResponseBody body) {\n          ...\n        });\n\n","children":[{"returnType":{"name":"Future","refId":"dart.async/Future","arguments":[{"name":"HttpRequestBody","refId":"http_server/HttpRequestBody"}]},"isStatic":true,"kind":"method","name":"processRequest","id":"processRequest2()","comment":"\nProcess and parse an incoming [HttpRequest].
